## Preseason

In season 9 preseason, we are getting stat shards(which already work in the program) but its going to be a few days before champion.gg gets updated which means i've simply made every runepage have +10 adaptive x2 and HP until champion.gg gets updated.

## Features
- [x] Works in and out of champion select.
- [x] Garena Support (Thanks Secret)
- [x] Supports champion.gg
